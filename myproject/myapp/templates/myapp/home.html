              <li>Use leftovers creatively to make new meals or snacks</li><br>
              <li>Compost food scraps instead of throwing them in the trash</li><br>

            <h2>The Environmental Impact of Food Waste</h2>
            <p>Food waste has a significant impact on the environment, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, water waste, and loss of biodiversity. Here are some facts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Food waste generates an estimated 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions</li><br>
              <li>25% of freshwater used for agriculture is wasted on food that is never eaten</li><br>
              <li>When food goes to waste, so does the land, energy, and resources used to produce it</li><br>
            </ul>
            <p>By reducing food waste, we can help mitigate the environmental impact and create a more sustainable future for all. Learn more about how you can make a difference:</p>
